## Introduction

In the modern retail landscape, understanding customer preferences, shopping patterns, and revenue projections is crucial for supermarkets. This project aims to provide valuable insights into these aspects using machine learning regression models. By leveraging techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more, we aim to predict sales and analyze factors that influence customer behavior within a supermarket environment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Supermarket Sales" dataset, available in the file `supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv`. It contains a comprehensive collection of supermarket transaction records, customer details, and associated features.

## Methodology

To achieve our goals, we employed the following methodology:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created relevant features that could provide deeper insights into customer behavior and sales patterns.

3. **Regression Models**: Implemented a range of regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.

5. **Interpretation**: Analyzed the model results to gain insights into the relationships between features, customer behavior, and sales.
